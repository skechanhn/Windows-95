**Do not run the ISO directly on your computer!**  
Always use a virtual machine to run Windows 95.  
Running the ISO outside a VM can damage your system, is not supported, and may not work on modern hardware.



# VMs to use

VirtualBox (Recommended)

VMware

QEMU

86Box (if you want accuracy)

Put The ***Iso Win95 OSR2.ISO*** To The Setting Up Page ( if it says to  put iso )



Boot The VM 

The system should start from the CD-ROM automatically.



# Setup By DOS

When you see the DOS prompt:

A:\\> setup



# **Follow the on-screen installer**



Choose “Custom” if you want full control



Otherwise “Typical” works fine

# Restart When Promped

Make sure the iso stays mounted until setup finishes

\# Install drivers (Optional but recommended)



SoundBlaster drivers



SVGA / VESA video drivers



VM-specific additions (VirtualBox Guest Additions DO NOT work on Win95)



### FINISH SETUP AND ENJOY USING WINDOWS 95 INSIDE VM
